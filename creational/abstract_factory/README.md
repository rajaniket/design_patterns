# Abstract Factory Design Pattern in Flutter

## Overview
The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that helps you create groups of related objects without specifying their exact class types and concrete implementations. This pattern allows you to use a variety of styles or versions of these objects easily through a single class called a factory.

## Example Scenario
Imagine you are developing a multiplatform app that needs to support different types of buttons (e.g., Material and Cupertino buttons like flat buttons, text buttons, elevated buttons, etc.). Each platform has its own versions of these buttons. Managing platform-specific buttons throughout the app can become difficult. Instead, we can use a button factory to create these platform-specific buttons in an organized and flexible way.

## Steps to Define Abstract Factory Design

### 1. Abstract Products
Abstract products are interfaces or base classes defining the methods that concrete products must implement. In our case, it's like defining the rules that our products (buttons) have to follow.

```dart
// abstract product
abstract class Button {
  void render();
}
```

### 2. Concrete Products
Implement concrete classes that fulfill the contracts defined by the abstract products. This involves defining all types of related products to be used in your project.

```dart
// Material Buttons
class MaterialFlatButton implements Button {
  @override
  void render() {
    print("Rendering a Material flat button.");
  }
}

class MaterialElevatedButton implements Button {
  @override
  void render() {
    print("Rendering a Material elevated button.");
  }
}

// Cupertino Buttons
class CupertinoFlatButton implements Button {
  @override
  void render() {
    print("Rendering a Cupertino flat button.");
  }
}

class CupertinoElevatedButton implements Button {
  @override
  void render() {
    print("Rendering a Cupertino elevated button.");
  }
}
```

### 3. Abstract Factories
Define an interface for the factory, specifying methods for creating each type of product, such as Flat and Elevated buttons. This abstract factory establishes guidelines for the factory to produce products as needed.

```dart
// Define Abstract Factories that create those buttons.
abstract class ButtonFactory {
  Button createFlatButton();
  Button createElevatedButton();
}
```

### 4. Concrete Factories
Implement concrete factory classes that implement the abstract factory interface. It provides the logic for creating instances of concrete products.
It's like specialized factories that produce different styles of the same kind of products. For instance, one factory makes buttons that look like Cupertino buttons and another factory makes buttons that look like Material buttons.

```dart
// Concrete Factory - Material Button Factory
class MaterialButtonFactory implements ButtonFactory {
  @override
  Button createElevatedButton() {
    return MaterialElevatedButton();
  }

  @override
  Button createFlatButton() {
    return MaterialFlatButton();
  }
}


// Concrete Factory - Cupertino Button Factory
class CupertinoButtonFactory implements ButtonFactory {
  @override
  Button createElevatedButton() {
    return CupertinoElevatedButton();
  }

  @override
  Button createFlatButton() {
    return CupertinoFlatButton();
  }
}
```
### 5. Use It
The client code works with factories and products only through their abstract interfaces. This makes it possible to create different product families by passing different factories to the client code.

```dart
void main() {
  final isAndroidPlatform = true;

  // Choose a factory based on the platform
  ButtonFactory buttonFactory =
      isAndroidPlatform ? MaterialButtonFactory() : CupertinoButtonFactory();

  // Create buttons using the factory
  Button flatButton = buttonFactory.createFlatButton();
  Button elevatedButton = buttonFactory.createElevatedButton();

  // Render the buttons
  flatButton.render();
  elevatedButton.render();
}
```

### Conclusion
The Abstract Factory Pattern helps you create groups of related objects for different platforms in a way that hides the specific details of each type. You can easily switch between different styles and platforms by using different factories, making your code flexible and easy to maintain.
